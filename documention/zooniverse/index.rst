The primary goal of this project is to interact with zooniverse. This comes in two flavors: exporting data to be uploaded to zooniverse and importing data that has been classified in zooniverse.

The module :mod:`solar.zooniverse.export` contains the functionality required for exporting the data, and :mod:`solar.zooniverse.zimport` is used to import the data.


Data is imported as python classes that contains the information required to process the data. Information about these classes can be found in :doc:`importstructs`.
