Metrics
=======


Most clustering algorithms allow for the use of custom metrics in the form of a distance matrix.
This is a 2D square array where the ij component is the distance between the ith object and the jth object.

We have implemented a number of custom metrics for describing the distances between rectangles and points so that they may be aggregated.

These metrics are found in the module :mod:`solar.agg.metrics`.
