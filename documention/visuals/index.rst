The zooniverse project is fundamentally visual, so there are a wide range of classes to create the desired images.

:doc:`imagegen` has two components. First there is the basic visual factory, that knows how to create and save visuals given some input files. 

:doc:`vidgen` is similar to image generation, but at present is much lest robust.

Secondly, there are :doc:`annotations`, which are addons, like circles and rectangles, which can be added on top of the images.
